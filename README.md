# ESE519_Final_Proj
Our final project is a double mode robotic car which incorporates two major functionalities: Manual WIFI Control and Auto Avoidance. Through the control panel of the mobile phone UI with the use of Blynk which we used in the last lab, users are able to switch between automatic and manual mode through the virtual buttons on the user panel. Under manual mode, users can control the vehicle in all basic directions (forward, backward, left turn, right turn, acceleration, etc.) by using the virtual buttons on the Blynk app. Under automatic mode, the vehicle is guided by a PTZ distance sensor on top of the gimbal system to conduct 180 degree environment monitoring without intervention, and actively avoid obstacles within 20cm from the front, left and right directions of the vehicle.
